# Tube Reader User Manual

## Introduction
This page is a work in progress and will be updated according to progress on the project. 

This repository contains software and electronics designs for an ultra-low cost luminescence reader developed by the BioEngineering team at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub (CZB). This module is being developed in response to the need for a low-cost, handheld, high-sensitivity luminescence reader that can be used in low-resource settings for a split-luciferase COVID-19 diagnostic test. This assay was developed in the lab of Jim Wells at UCSF, and in collaboration with Cristina Tato at CZB, and Manu Prakash at Stanford. 

Each module will read luminescence values from between 1-8 PCR tubes simultaneously, depending on the number of detector modules that are hooked up to the device. A tube reader module will be composed of:
- 1-8 detector modules
- ADC module
- Raspberry Pi
- LCD touchscreen
